crafting system:
    - defined by recipes (like cooking)
        - made up of a series of steps
            - most steps are ordered
            - some steps can be concurrent
            - each step has
                - requirements
                    - room
                    - furniture
                    - items
                    - minimum skill
                    - tools
                    - possibly other recipe
                - related skill
                - process name or type(eg. 'fold', 'saw', 'saute')
                    - will display with skill eg. 'woodworking - saw' vs 'surgery - saw'
                - difficulty
                - perceptions
                    - per caste
                    - examples:
                        - distasteful
                        - highly skilled
                        - prohibited
                    - (sidenote: maybe should handle skill values/labors by processes as well?)
                - base (minimum) time
                - results
                    - items
        - can display (as checklist tree)
            - all its steps and their requirements
            - total reqs. & minumum time
        - requesting a recipe requests its requirements if necessary
            - can toggle on a whole or per step

caste system:
    - made up of individuals or groups
    - have customizable name
    - can add/remove individuals or groups
    - examples:
        - miners
        - military
        - nobles
        - peasants

group system:
    - made up of individuals
    - some are defined automatically
        - examples:
            - immediate family
            - extended family
            - friends
            - pets
        - usually equate to relationships
        - are uneditable by player
    - others are customizable
        - have customizable name
        - can add/remove individuals
    - examples:
        - familial
        - military squad
        - urist's mighty miners

- alternate grouping system
    - represent labors, restrictions, etc info as 'profiles' that can be assigned to whatever group
    - groups encompass the whole of individual/caste/etc
    - groups are essentially saved searches
    - con: lose the ability to store info per group eg. castes food prefs, other group-think

room system:
    - generic
        - has area (sq m)
        - has floor/wall material (with areas?)
    - specific (type or function)
        - examples:
            - bedroom
            - dining room
            - office
            - garden
            - workshop
            - tomb
        - can be owned
            - by individual(s) or group(s) only
                - (eg for groups: family bedroom)
            - owns the contents and the area
            - can store other owned items
        - can be assigned
            - to individual(s), group(s), or caste(s)
            - examples:
                - workshop: only assigned work here
                - bedroom: only assigned sleep here
                - dining room: only assigned eat here
            - owns neither contents nor area
            - can store owned items
        - levelled distinctions
            - examples:
                - minimum functional
                - basic
                - ordinary
                - comfortable
                - fine
                - grand
            - each level has requirements
                - space
                - furniture
                - decoration
                - other

shedules:
    - (like prison architect)
    - (paint them out like my calendar app idea)
    - define times to
        - eat
        - sleep
        - work
        - have free time
    - assigned per caste
    - individuals can break schedule if then have enough desire
        - will instead take free time
    - free time activities determined by individual preference
    - more schedule -> more stress
    - can set hard deadlines to exlude latecomers
        - encourages promptness
        - more stress
    - can set specifics to periods, eg:
        - sleep
            - nap
            - full
            - until rested
        - work
            - hard labor (gets more done at cost of stress)
            - enforced quota
                - will always display approximate quotas
                - high quotas cause more stress but speed labor
                - low quotas ensure a certain amount of product then free time
                - can force work until quota complete, missing other activities
        - eat
            - eat quickly
            - eat and socialize
            - snack only
            - full meal
            - eat at post
            - eat in dining room
    - can define rooms for periods (except free time)
    - added gameplay benefit of schedules:
        - can approximate where individuals are at any time
        - check schedule
            - check if any are breaking
            - determine freetime activities based on preference as normal
            - place all individuals at activity in semi-random stages
                - assume progress based on schedule vs expected quotas

meals:
    - composed of different nutrients
        - nutrients could be
            - generic categories? eg:
                - protein
                - vegetable
                - carbs
                - fats
                - etc
            - specific vitamins/minerals/chemicals? eg:
                - vit. D
                - vit. B12
                - fluorine
                - lipids
                - proteins
                - carbohydrates
            - hybrid of above?
                - general categories with some specific 'specials'
                    - ('specials' linked to various effects, eg. fluorine, calcium to dental care)
        - each individual needs various nutrients to survive
        - too little of some results in malnutrition diseases (eg. scurvy)
    - made from recipes (outlined in crafting above)
        - some recipes provided &/ discovered
        - can make own recipes
    - finished meals and ingredients have
        - quality
        - 'exotic' vs 'mundane' value
            - how often it is eaten by that caste (individual?)
        - 'fanciness' (nobility preference)
    - resultant values are based on
        - ingredient values
        - preparation methods
        - preparation time
        - eg. a souffle will be higher status than a fried egg
            - due to both ingredients and preparation

engravings:
    - give decoration mood bonus
        - diminishing returns from quantity/spacing
            - unless cohesive (eg. saga or patterned
        - extra bonus from relation to room function
            - eg epitaphs, well-wishes, and accomplishments in tomb
    - can be ordered specifically
        - choose the type and contents with any level of detail
    - can be left to engraver's choice
        - tries to match room function
        - sometimes encorporates engraver's preference
    - each has certain style tags
        - examples:
            - genres:
                - stylistic
                - realistic
            - descriptors:
                - heavy
                - deep
                - sharp
                - flowing
            - moods:
                - macabre
                - disturbing
                - playful
                - austere
        - chosen mostly by the engraver's preference
        - over time the engraver will develop a signature style
